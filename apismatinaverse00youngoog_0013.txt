Carmen Shirbumiense, written in 1887, owes what·
ever vitality it possessos to the spirited setting
(W eekes and Co.) of my friend Mr L N. Perker, for
many years Orgnnist and Director of Music at Sher·
borne School.

Ι am indebted for vnlneble help in the teek
of selection and revision to my former collengue,
ΜΓ R n Bowen of Hannon, and to my old pnpil
Mr E O. F. Menon, Assistant Master at Haileybnry

s College To the latter Ι am also under obligetion

for permission to pn‘nt his gracefinl elegiae rendering Ι
of the memorial lines on page 194.

Ronnnnnn.
Decenbor, 1899.
