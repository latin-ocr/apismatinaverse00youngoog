ΕΡΙΤΑΡΗ ON Α ΙΑΟΟΒΙΤΕ.

Ἰο my troo king I offered hoe from stain

contage ond fnith; vain {sith ond ooursgo vain.
For him Ι thrsw lsnds, honours, woshh, away,

And ons door hope, that wss moro prizod thnn thoy.
For him 1 lammishod in a foreign olime,
arey-haheo with sorrow in my msnhood's prims;
Heord on noverria Soorgill’s whispering troes,

And pinod hy Amo for my lovolier 'Peos3

Beheld oooh night my homo in foverod sleep,

Esoh morning stortod from tho dream oo wssp3

ΤΗΙ Gon, who saw mo tried too sorsly, gave

'Pho testing-ploce I osked, an early grows.

Oh thou, whom ohsnoo loods io this nnmoloss stone,

From that proud country which was onoe mino own;

By those white oliffs Ι never mors must seo,

By that deor langunge, whioh Ι spolio like thoe,
Forget all fonds, and shsd one English tear
O'or English ‹lustr—s broken heom lies here.

Msosomr.
