1 PRAISED 'l'HE EAR'lH‚ IN BEAU'l'Y finan.

1 praised tha earth, in beauty seen
with garlanda gay of various gream
l praised tha sea, whose ampla field
Shone glorioua aa a silver shield;
And earth and ocean saem'd to say,
‘our beautiaa ara but for a day!

l praised the sun, whose chariot roll'd

On wheels of amber and of gold;

I praised the moon, whose aofter eye
Gleam'd swaetly through the summer aky;

And moon and sun in answer said,
‘Our days of light are numberll’

0 Godl Ο good beyond compare!

If thus Thy meaner works are fair,

If thus 'l'hy bounties gild the span
of ruin’d earth and sinful man,

How glorious must the mansion be,
where Thy redeemed shall dwell with Thee!
