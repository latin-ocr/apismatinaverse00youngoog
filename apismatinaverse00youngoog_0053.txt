RIOHARD III. Act L Se. IV.

Brak. Hed you euch leisure in the time of death
'1¹0 gaze upon theee secrete of the deep?
mer. Methought, I hed3 end osten did I etrive
'1¹0 yield the gheet: bue still the envioue flood
Kept in my seul, end would not let it forth,
'l'o eeek the empty, vest, end wandering eir3
But emothered it within my penting bulk,
Which almost buret to beleh it in the see
Brak. Awehed you not with this eone agonyz
δίων. Oh no, my dream was lengthened efter life;
Ο then began the tempeet ho my seul!
I passed, methought, the melancholy flood,
with that grim femymen which poete write of,
Unho the kingdom of perpetual night„
'Phe finnt that there did greet my strange seul,
’ Wee my great father-inlew, renowned Werwieh,

Who eried ahud—‘What eeourge for perjury
Oen this derk monerehy afford fahe clarence?
