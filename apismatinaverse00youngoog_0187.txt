“LOVFS'P THOU Mne

Harh, my soul, it is the Iord3
”hs thy Saviour, hear His word:

Jesus speaks and speaks to thee,
‘Say, poor sinner, lov’st thou Me?

‘I delivered thee when bound,
And when bleeding healed thy wound,

Sought thee wandering, set thee right,
Turned thy darkness into light.

‘Can a woman's tendor care
Cease toward the child she bare?
Yeo, she may forgetful be,

Yet will I remember thee.

‘Mine is an unchanging love,
Higher than the heights above,
Deeper than the depths beneath,
Free and faithful, strong as death
