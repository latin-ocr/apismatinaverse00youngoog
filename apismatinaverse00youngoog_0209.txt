Whereeeho is deusto oureall,
'l'iid out with his playing end learning,
'l'het letely m stronger than alle
We loved him: eh yes, when he led us,

We rallied ee one to his eheer,
l'he hero we looked for to head us,
Our chief without peer.

So simple, no child could misdoubt him,
Lightheerted himself as a child:

How dim were our triumphs without him!
How cloudless defeat when he smiledl

He ie gone, end we know not the wherefere,
But surely our seith shall be this,

'Phae he ceres for the things that we care for,
Albeit in bliss.
