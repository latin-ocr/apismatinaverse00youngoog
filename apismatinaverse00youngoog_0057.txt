THE SAILOR BOY.

He rose at dawn and, fired with hope,
Shot 0’er the seething whom-bar,

And reach'd tho ship and caught the rope,
And whistled to the morning star.

And while he whistled long and loud,
He heard a fierce mermaiden cry,

‘0 boy, tho’ thou art young and proud,
I soe the plaee where thou wilt lie.

‘The sands and yeasty surges mix

In caves about the dreary bay,
And on thy ribs the limpet sticks,

And in thy beart the sorawl shall play!
