' THE MAID 01⁴¹ NEIDPATH.

Earl March look’d on his dying child,
And emit with grief to view her-
“l'he youth: he oried, ‘whom 1 exiled,

shffl be ‚restored to woo her!

Sho's at the window many an hour
His coming to discover:

And he looked up to Ellen’s bower
And she 100k0d'0n her lover.

But ah! so pale, he knew her not

'Phough her smile on him was dwelling—
‘And am 1 then forgot‚—forg0t2’
. lt broke tho heart of Ellen.

In vain he weeps, in vain he sighs‚
Her cheek is oold as ashes3
Nor love's own kiss shall wake those eyes

'1¹0 list their silken lashes.
