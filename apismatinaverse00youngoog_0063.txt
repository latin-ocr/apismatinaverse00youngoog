Β. Therewilllmakethoebedsofroses,
And a thousand fragrant posies,
A cap of flowers‚ and 111118,
Embroider’d all with leaves of myrtle.

P. 'rho flowers do fade, and wauton fields
'1¹0 wayward winter reckoning yields ;
A honey tongue, a heart of gall
Is fancy's spring, but sorrow’s 1111

S. 'Phe' shepherd swains shall danoe and sing ι
For thy delight each May-morning,
If these delights thy mind may move

ι 'fo live with me and be my love.

P. But could youth last and love 81111 breed,

Had joys no date uorago no need,
'l'hen those delights my mind might move
'1¹0 live with thee and be thy love.
