Iremember, Ι remember

Where I was need tn ming,

And thought the air must rnsh es fresh
'Po ewallows on the wing:

My spirit flew in feathere then

'rhet ie so heevy now,

And summer pools could hardly 0001
'Phe fever on my brow.

I remember, I remember

'l'he fir trees derk and high;
I used to think their slender tops
Were close against the sky.

It was a ehildish ignorante,

But now ’tis little joy

'Po know I’m fe1ther off from Hoeven
'Phan when I was a boy.
