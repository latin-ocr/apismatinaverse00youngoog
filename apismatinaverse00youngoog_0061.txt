THE PASSIONATE SHEPHERD ΤΟ HIS hove

S. Come live with me and be my love,
And we will all the pleasures prove
'l'hst hills and velleys, deles ond fields,
Woods or soeepy mountain yields

P. If that the world and love were young,
And truth in every shepherd's tongue,
These pretty pleasures might me move
Το live with thee end be thy love.

S. And we will sit upon the rocks,
Seeing the shepherds feed their floolrs,
By shallow rivers, to whose falls
Melodious birds sing msdn'gels.

P. But time drives flocks from field 1ο sold,
When rivers rege and rocks grow sold,

And Philomel becometh dumb‚
And all comploin of seres to come.
