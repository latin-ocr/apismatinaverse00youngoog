SOHRAB AND RUS'FUM.

He sp0k03 but Rustum geeed end gued, end stood

Speeehless3 end then he uttered one eherp cry 3

‘0 bey-thy father 1'-end hie voiee choked there:

And then a derk cloud paes'd before hie eyes,

And hie head ewam, and he senk down to earth.
But Sohrab crawl’d te where he lay, and cest

Hie arms about his neck, end kissed hie lips,

And with fond faltering fingere strok'd hie cheeke,

Trying to eall him beel< te life3 and life

Came beck to Ruetum, end he oped hie eyes,

And they stood wide with horror3 and he seized

In both his hands the dust which lay around,

And threw it on hie head, and smirch'd his hair,

Hie hair, end face, and beard, end glittering armsJ

And strong convulsive groaninge ehook his breaet,
And his sobe choked him3 and he clutch'd hie swerd,
&mmmmwmffim

But Sohsab eaw his thought, end held his hands,
And with e seothing voice he spoke, and said :—
