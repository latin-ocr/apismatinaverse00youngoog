And eo he vanieh’d: then came wandering by

Α ehedow like en angel, with bright heir
Dabbled in blood; and he ehriek'd out eloud-
‘Glereneeieeome,—false,fleeting,pe1jured maroneo,
'rhet stebbed me in the field by 'l'ewkeebury3

Seize on him, funes, take him te your tormonte!
with that, methought, a legion of foul fienda
Environ'd me, end howled in mine ears

Such hideous eries, that, with the very noise,

I trembling wak'd, and, for e season efter

could not believe but that 1 was in hell,

Such terrible impression made my dream.
