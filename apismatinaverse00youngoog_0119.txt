Boou mmkod my unsuooeosful paim
With fix’d oonoiderato foco,

And pumling sot his puppy hrains
'Po comprohend the caso.

But with a oherup clear ond strong,
Dispersing all his droam,

I thonoo withdraw and follow’d long
'Phe windings of the stream.

My ramblo ondod, 1 return'd‚
Boou trotting for before,

'rho floating wroath again disoem'd‚
And plunging left tho shore.

l saw him with that lily oropp'd

Impatient swim to moot
My quiok approach, ond soon ho dropp’d
'Pho measure ab my fooo

omrm’d with the sight, the world, Ι criod,
shall hear of this thy deod:

My dog shall mortify the pride
Of mon's superior breed.

But chief myself Ι will enjoin,
Awako at duty's coll,

'Po show a lovo os prompt ao thino,
To Him, who gives mo all.

omma.
