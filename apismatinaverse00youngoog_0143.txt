ΟΝ Δ WI'PHERED 'PREE IN ΤΗΒ moe-REGAL
GROUNDS ΛΤ DUBLIN.

Peor tree! a gentle mistress plaeed thee here,
'1¹0 be the glery of the glede around:
'l'hy life hes not survived one fleeting year,

And she too sleeps beneath another mound. Ι

But mark what diff'ring terme your fetes allow3
vhe like the periodos your ewift deeey,

'Phine are the sepless root and withered bough3
Here the green mem'ry and immortel day.

Loen cmm.
