RULB erANNIAr

When Britain first at Heaven's command
Areae from out the arura main,

'Phia was the charter or* the land,
And guardian angele sang this strain.

Rule Britannia! Britannia mles the waves!
Britons never shail be slaves!

'Phe natione, notro blest as thee,
Must in their turns tn tyrants fallÍ¾
While thou shalt flourish great and free,
rho dread and envy of them all.

Still more majestie shalt thou rise,

More dreadful from eaeh foreign stroke3
As the loud blast that tears the skies
Servos but to root thy native oelr.
