Horatio’s servant onoo, with bow ond oringo

Swinging tho paloor-door upon its hingo,
Drooding o negativo, and ovemwod
Leo ho should treoposo bogg'd 1ο go obrood.

Noy: stay ot homo—you'ro always going out—
’his but o step, sir, justat tho streeo's ond—
For whoth-An ploase you, sir, 1ο soo o friond-
A friend, Horatio oried, and soom'd tostam,
Yon, marry sholt thou, ond with all my hoorh
And fotoh my olooh3 for though the night bo ray,
I’ll soe him too—tho first Ι over saw.

Ι knew tho mon, ond knew his nature mild,
And was his ploy‘ohing often when a ohild;
But somowhot ot that moment pinoh'd him close,

Else he was soldom bitter or moroso.
Perhaps, his confidonoe just then botroy'd,

His grief might prompt him with tho spoooh he mode.

Perhaps 'toas moro good-humour gave 11 birth,
'Pho hmmloss play of ploosontry and mirth.
Howo’or 11 was, his longuoge, in my mind,
Bospoko ot least a man thot know mankind.

· But not 1ο morolizo too muoh, ond strain

'fo provo an ovil of whioh all comploin,
