She loy among tho myrtlos on tho oliff :

Α Abovo her glored tho noon; beneoth, tho seo.
Upon tho white horizon Athos' ponh

weltorod in burning hnzo; all ains wore dead;
'Pho oioolo slepi among the tamorisk'o hair;
'Pho birds sat dumb and drooping. For below
Tho lony seo-weod glistonod in tho sun,

The laoy ooo-fowl driod their steoming wings,
'Pho laoy swoll kept whisporing up the lodge,
And sonk again. Greot Pon was laid oo rost3
And Mothor Eorth wotohed by him ns ho oleph,
And hushed her myriad children for a while.

. She loy among the myiiles on the oliff

And sighod for oleep-for sleep that would noh hear,
But left her tossing still: ior night ond doy
A mighty hungonyeorned within her heart

'Pill nll hor veins ron fever3 and her oheek,
