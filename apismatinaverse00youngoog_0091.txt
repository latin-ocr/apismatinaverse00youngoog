Fnor. Marsy, this well carried shall on her beholf

change slender to remorse; thet is some good:
But not for thot dieom 1 on this strange eourse,

But on this travail look sor greater birth.
She dying, es it must be so maintained,
Upon the instent thet she wss aeoused,
Shnll be lemented, pitied, ond exoused

01 every hearer: for it so falls out
'Phet what we hove we prize not to the worth,

Whiles we enjoy it; but being lnek'd and lost,
Why, then we reok the value3 then we find
The virtue thet possession would not show us
Whiles it was ours-So will it fere with Claudio:
When he sholl henr she died upon his words,
'Phe ideo 01 her life shall sweetly oreep

Into his study 01 imagination,

And every lovely orgen 01 her life

shall eome apparell'd in more preeious habit,
More moving delicate ond full 01 life

Into the eye nnd prospect 01 his soul,

'l'hen when she lived indeed.
