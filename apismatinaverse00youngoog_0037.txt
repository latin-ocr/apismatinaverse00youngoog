00RONAOH.

He is gone on the mountain,
He is lost to the forest,
Like a summerdn'ed fountain,

When our need was the sorest.

'Phe fount reappearing
From the rain-drops shall borrow,

But to us eomes no oheering,

'1ยน0 Duncan no morrow.

'l'he hand of the reaper
'Pakee the ears that are hoary,
But the voice of the weeper ,
Wails manhood in glory.
The Autumn winde rushing
Wast the leaves that are searest,
But our flower was in flushing,

When blighting was nearese
