SONG.

now mot 1 mamm from field to field, Ν ‘

And tmted all the summer pride,
'fill Ι the Pn'nco of bove behold,
who in the sunny bemus did glide.

He showed me lilios for my hair,
And blushing roses for my br0w3
He led me through his gmdens fair,

where all his golden pleasures gwy.

With sweet Maydews my wings were yet,
And Phoebus fired my vocal rago:

He caught me in his silken net,
And shut me in his golden cage.

He loves to sit and hear me sing,

Then, laughing, plays and sports with me;
'Phen stretohes out my golden wing,

And mocks my loss of liberty.
