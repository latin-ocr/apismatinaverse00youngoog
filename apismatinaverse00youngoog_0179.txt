DEPAR'PED DAYS.

Yee, deer deperted oherished days,
could Memory’s hond restore

Your morning light, your evening reys

From 'Pimo'e groy urn once mom:
'i'hen might this restless heort bo still,
'l'his attaining eye might close,
And Hope her fninting pinions fold
While the fair phentoms rose.

But like e child in ocean’s arms
We etrive against the stream,
Eeeh moment further from the shore
Where life's young founteins gleem :—
Eeeh moment feinter weve the fieids
And wider rolls the see ;
'Phe mist grows derk—the sun goes down-

Day breaks—end where are we?

Omvnn Wnnnnnn Honnns.
