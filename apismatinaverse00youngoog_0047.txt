cHlnnHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.

Once on a time, when sunny May
Was kissing up the April ahenam,

I saw fair Ohildheod, hard at play,
Upon a bank ef hlushing flowers:

Happy-he knew not whence or how—

And smiling—who could choose but love him?
For not more glad than childhood’s brow

Was the blue heaven that beamed above him.

Old Time, in mest appalling wrahh,
'Phat valley’s green reposo invaded;
The brooks grew dhy upon his path,
'l'he birds were mute, the lilies faded.
But Time so swiftly winged his ffighe,
In haste a Grecian tomb to better,
'l'hat childhood watched his papar kiae,
And knew just nothing of the matter.
