'PHE DOG AND 'FHE WATER-LILY.

The noon was shady, and soh airs
Swept Ouse’s silenh tide,

whe'n, 'soapod from literary caree,
Ι wander'd on his sida

My spaniel, prettiest of his moe,
And high in pedigree,

(Two nymphs adom'd with every grace
what spaniel found for me,)

Now wanton’d, lost in flags and reeds,
Now, sharting into sight,

Pursued the swallow 0'er the meads
With scarae a slower flighh.

ΙΙ was the time when Ouse display’d
His lilies newly blown3

Their beauties Ι inbenh survey'd,
And one Ι wish'd my owh

With cane extended far Ι sought
Το sheer it close to land,

But still the prize, though nearly caught,
Escaped my eager hand.
