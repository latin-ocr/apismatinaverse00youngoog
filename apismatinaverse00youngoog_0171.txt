And still they rowed emidst the rear

Of wetere fest preveiling3
Lcrd Ullin reached that fate] shore,—

His wreth wes changed to weiling.

For scre dismey’d, through storin and shede
His child he did discover:
One lovely hand she stretehed for eid,

And one wes round her lover.

‘Come beck! come backl' he cried in grief
‘Aeross this stormy water:
And 1'11 forgive your Highlend chief,

My daughter! O my daughteri'

’Twes vein: the loud waves leshed the shore,
Rehurn or eid preventing:

'Phe wetere wild went 0’er his child,

And he was left lercenting.

Cererem.
