0 silvery etreemlee of the fielde‚
'rhet floweet full end free,
For thee the teins of spring retem,

'Phe Summer dewe for thee:
And when the latest bloeeome die

In Autumn'e ehilly showers,
'I'he Winter founteins gueh for thee,
Till Mey brings beck the fiowere.

0 stream of life, the violet springs
But once beside thy bed;

But one brief Summer on thy path

The dewe of heaven are ehed:
Thy parent founteine shrink ewey,
And close their crystel veine‚
And where thy glittering current flowed‚

The duet elene remaine.

Beem.
