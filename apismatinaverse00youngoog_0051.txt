'I'hen Wiedom stole hie bet and bell,
And taught him, with most sege endeavour,
why bubblee riee and eeome fall,

And why no toy may last for ever.
she talked of ell the wondrous hwe,

Which Nature’e open book dieeloeee,
And ehildhood, ere she made a pause,
Wes fast esleep among the roeee.

Sleep on, eleep on! Oh Menhood'e dreems
Are all of earehly pain, or pleneme,
Of Glory’s teile, Ambition’s sehemee,
of eheriehed love, or boarded tmeeure:
But to the eouoh where Ohildhoed lies
A more delicioue tranee is given,
hit up by rays from seraph eyes,
And glimpses of remember'd heaven!
