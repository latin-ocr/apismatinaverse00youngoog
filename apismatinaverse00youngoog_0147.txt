PABADISE REGAINED, L neeâ€”320.

Sospekeourhiorningsstantheninflisriee,
And looking round en every eide, beheld

A peehleoe desert, dush with horrid ehedee

'l'he wey He eeme not having marked, return
Was difficult, by humen steps untrod3

And He still on was led, but with sueh thought
Aeeompenied of things past and to come
hodged in His breest, ee well might reeommend
Such solitude before ehoicest society.

Full forty days He passed, whether on hill
Sometimes, anon in shady vale, each night
Under the eovert of some ancient oek

Or cedar, to defend Him from the dew,

Or herboured in one eave, is not reveeled3

Nor tested human foed, nor hunger felt
