ῬΟ OUR GENIUS.

HARROW TEROENTENARY.
ὅση lm, 1871.

Goddoss of the leafy hill,

Nymph‚ or Mum, or what you will,
With the light begins the lay,
Herga, be our guest to-day!

Don the belt of purple hue,
Don the kerohief white and hlue,

And amid thy tresses streaming

Set the mimio arrows gleaming.

come, and with the jocund twain,
Jest and Mirth, that bear thy train,

Simple Modesty combine,
And sober-minded Discipline.

Here by happy omen sped,
Numa-like, our sire, 'tis said,
Reared a resting·place for thee
And the maids of Castaly.

'l'hrice a hundred years have rolled3
Come where sleeps thy patron old;

Yearly thus we own thy sway ;
Herm, be our help to-day1
