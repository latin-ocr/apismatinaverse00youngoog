Her long thin hande end ivery-ehennelled 1001

Were wanted with the westing of her seul.

'l'hen peeviehly she flung her on her feee

And hid her eye-belle from the blinding glere,
And fingered 01 the grase, and tried 1ο 0001

Her eriep hot lipe against the erisp hot swerd.
And then she raised her head, and upwerd caet
Wild looks from homelees eyeS, whose liquid light

Ae gleem twin lakes, between the purple peeke
Of deep Parnassus, eb the moumful moon.

Beeide her lay her lyre. She enebehed the ehell,
And weked wild music from ite silver strings3

‘Deed offspring 01 the borboiee end the mine!
Why moek my discorde with thine hermonien,
Albhough a ebriae-olympian 101 be thine,

Only 10 echo beck in every tone

'l'he meede 01 nobler neburee then thine ownb'
