By this the storm grew loud opere,

'Phe water-maith was shrieking;
And in the soowl of heaven eeeh face

Grew dnrk es they were speaking.

But still ns wilder blew the wind
And es the night grew dreerer,

Adown thelglen rode armed men,

'l‘heir trampling sounded noaret.

‘0 hoste thee, hostet’ the lady eries,
‘'Phough tempests round us gethem

I’ll fene the raging of the skies
But not an angry father!

'Phe boet hos left a stormy lond,

A stormy see before her,—
When, 0! too strong for human hand
'Phe tempest gethered o’er her.
