owen HUNTING.

'l'he eubtle spoiler, of the beaver kind,
Fer off perhaps, where ancient nlders shede

'l'he deep still peel, within some hcllcw trunk

Contriwes hie wicker conch: whence he survcye

His long purlieu, lcrd cf the stream, and ah

'I'he finny shoele, his own. Here, huntsmnn, bring
Thy eager pech, end treil him tc his couch:
Quick fix the nets and cut off hie retreat

Into the eheltering deeps. Ah, there he vente!
'Phe pach plunge hccdlong, and protended speers
Menace destruction: While the troubled surge
Indignnnt focms, and all the sccly kind

Affrighted hide their heads: Wild tumult reigns
