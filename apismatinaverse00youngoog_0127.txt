He swayed his resim of grass, and planned, and wrough‘c3
Warned rash intrudere from che tended sward3

A workmm, deeming‚ for the friends he taught,
No service hard

He found, behind first hilare, more succees3
Gheered scou‘c endeavour more 'chan languid skill3
And ruled che heart of boyhood with the stress
Of helpful will 3

Or, standing at our hard-fought gamo, would look,
silent and patient, drowned in hope and sear,
'hill the lips quivered, and the strong voice shook

With low glad cheer.

Well played. His life was honestes than ours3
We scheme, he worked, we hesitate, he spoke;

His rough·hewn stem held no concealing flowers,
But grain of oak.

No 'earthly umpire speaks his grave above3
And ‘chanhs are dumb, and praise is all too late;
Thac worth and cnuth, chae manhood and that love
Are hid, and waic.

Sleep gentlw where thou sleepest‚ dear old friend3
Think, if thou thinhes‘c, on the brigh'c days pasc;
Yet loftier hove, and worthier 'Pruth attend
What more thou hasti
