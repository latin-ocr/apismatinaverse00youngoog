'l'he moony vapour rolling round the ffing,
Who seem’d the phantom of a giant in it,
Enwound him fold by sold, and made him gray

And grnyer, till himself became ns mist
Before her, moving ghostlike to‘ his doom.

'Phen she stretch'd out her arms and cried ndoud

‘Oh AsnhurV there her voice brake suddenly,
'l'hnn-as a stream that sponting from a oliff Ι

. Faus in mid air, but gnthering nt the base

Ro—mnkes inoff, and flashns down the vale-

Went on in passionate utteranne.
