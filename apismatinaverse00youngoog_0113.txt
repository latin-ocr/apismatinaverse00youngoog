Ήιο boy stood on the burning dook
whence ao out he heo oen

Ήιο fleme that lit the battle's wreok
Shone round him o'er the deod:

Yet beautiful end brighh he stood,
As horn to rule the etorm;

A creature of heroic blood,
¹A proud though child-like form.

The flames rolled on-He would not go
without hie father's word:

Thoe father, faint in death below,
His voioe no longer heard.

He called aloud-‘Sey‚ father, say,
If yet my taek is done2'

He knew not that the ohieftain loy

Unooneoioue of his son.
