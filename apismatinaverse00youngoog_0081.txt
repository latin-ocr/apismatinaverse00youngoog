'Phoe haughty tymnts ne’er shall tamo ;
All their attempta 1ο bend thee down
will but arouse thy generous fiame,

But work their ποθ and thy renown.

'1¹0 thee belongs the rural reign3
'Phy cities shall with commemo shine ;
All thino shall be the subject main,
And every shore it circlos, thino.

'l'he Muses, still with smedom found,
Shall 1ο thy happy coast repair;

Blest Islel with matchless beauty orowned,
And manly hearts 1ο guard the fair.
