Arethusa arose
From her eoueh of shows

In the Acroceraunian mountaine-
From cloud and from cmg,
With many a jag

Shepherding her bright founteins.
She leapt down the rocks,

With her rainbow looks
Streaming among the streamsÍ¾

Her steps paved with green
'l'he downward tevine,
Which slopes to the western gleems:
And gliding and> springing
She went, ever singing
In murmure ee soft as eleep:
The Eerth seemed to love her,
And Heaven smiled above her,
Ae she lingered towards the deep.
