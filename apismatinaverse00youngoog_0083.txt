Loss OF 'I'HE ROYAL GEORGE.

'l'oll for the bravo!

'Phe bravo that are no more!

All sunk beneath the wave
Fut by their native shore!

night hundsed of the bravo,
whose ooumge well was tried,

Had made the vessel hoel
And laid her on hor side.

A land-breem shook the shrouds

And she was overset:
Down went the Royal Georgo,
With all her οῖον complete.

'Poll for the bravo!

Brave Kempenfelt is gone ;
His last sea fight is fought,
His work of glory done.

It was not in the battle;
No tempest gave the shock ;

she sprang no fatal leak,
She ran upon no rock
