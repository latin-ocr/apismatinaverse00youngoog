with a purch at my door, both for shelter md shndo too,
As the sunshine or min my pmmih

Andamllspot ofgroundfortheuae of tho spadam,
with a barn for the use of the flail:

A θον for my dairy, a dog for my gamm
And a purae when a friend wmts to bomow3

I’ll envy no nabob his richae or fame,

Nor what honours await him tomorrow.

From the bleak northern blast may my cotbeoompletely ,
Secured by a neighbouring hill; Ι
And at night may repose εἰει] upon me more sweetly

By the sound of a neighbouring rill:

And while peaoe and plenty I find at my board,
With a beart free from sickness and sorrow,

With my sn'ends may I share what today may afford,
And let them spread the table w-morrow.
