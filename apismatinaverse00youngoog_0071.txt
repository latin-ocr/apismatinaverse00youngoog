AN uplsuuu ῬΟ JosuPH thh, ESQ„

Dear Joseph,—five and twenty years ago-

Alas, how time escapes 1—'tis even so—

With frequent intercourse, and always sweet

And always friendly, we were went to cheat

A oedious haur-and now we never meet!

Aa some gravo gentleman in Terence says

('Twas therefore much the same in ancient days),

Good lach, we know not what to-morrow brings—

Strange fluctuation of all human things!

Tuus. Chauges will befal] and friends may part,

But distance only cannot change the heart:

And, were I called to prove the assertion true,

One proof should serve-a reference to you.
thnee comes it then, thatin the wane of life,

'I'hough nothing have oecurr'd to kindle stuife,

We find the friends we fancicd we had wou,
Though numerous onec, reduced to few or none?
