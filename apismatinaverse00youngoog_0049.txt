With curling lip end gleucing eye,

Guilt gued upon the soene a minute;
But Childhood's glunee of purity

ssed such e holy spell within it,
'l'het the derk demon to the uir

Spreed forth egein his beffled piniorr,
And hid hie envy end despair,

Seli-tortured, in his own domiuion.

'lherr stepped agloomy phantom up,

Pele, eypreeeerowneh Night’s awfm daughter,
And proffered him e feerful cup

Full to the brim with bitter water:
Poor childhood bede her tell her neme3

And when the beidam muttered-‘Sorrowss
He said-‘Don't interrupt my geme ;

I'll teste it, if 1 must, t0·m0rrow.‘

'lhe muse of Pindus thither cume,

And wooed him with the subest numbers
'l'hut ever eeattered weelth and sume

Upon e youthful poet's elumbem:

Though eweet the musio of the luy,

'Po childhood it was ull a riddle,
, Anu ‘ou’ he ouer, ‘uo seur away
'l'brrt noisy women with the fidele! '
