A parrot from the Spaniflh main,
Fun young, and early cnged, came o’er
With bright wings to tho blank domnin
of Mulla’s shore.

'1¹0 spicy groves, where he had won
His plumnge of resplendent hue,
His native fluns, and skins, and sun,

He bade ndieu.

For these he changed the smoke of turs,
A honthery land and misty sky,

And turned on rocks and raging surf
His goldon eye.

But petted in our climate cold
He lived and chattered many a day3

Until with nge, from green and gold
His wings grew gray.
