’ΒΜ fatherv-onoe again ho oded,
‘Ifl may yet be gonev’

‘And‚'-but the booming shots mplied
And fast the flames rolled om

Upon his brow he felt their breath,

And in his waving hain
And looked from that lone post of death,
In still yet bravo despair.

He shouted yet once moro aloud,
‘My father! must 1 stay?

While 0'er him fast, through sail and shxoud,
'Phe wreathing fisos made way.

'l'hey wrapped tho ship in splendour wild,
They caught the flag on high,

And streamed above the gallant child,
Like hannem in the sky.

Then came a busst of thunder sound-
The boy—oh! where was he?

Ask of the winde, that far around
With fragments strewed the sea.

With mast and helm and pannon fair,
what well had borne their part-

But the noblest thing that perished there
Was that young, faithful heart.

Fmou Hmus.
