'l'hen Alpheus bold
011 his glscier sold

With his trident the mountains strook‚
And opened a ohssm
In the rocks 2-with the spasm
All Erymanthus shook3
And the blech south wind
It ooneeeled behind
'rho urns of the silent snos,
And esrthqueke and thunder

Did rend in sunder
'Phe bars of the springs below,
she heard and the hair

0f the River-god were

Seen through the torrent's sweep,
As he followed the light

0f the fleet nymph's ssight
Το the brink of the Dorian deep.

Susum.
