116

'I'hon sudden dukness fell: the seed
Lay coffinod with the mighty dead,

While centurias of human deod
Unhwd were passing overhead

When next it woke, the earth was old:
Four thousand years had oeasod to be,
As from this plot of English mould
It looked and breathed on you and me.

Haill fair white flower and fragrant brenth,
what, symbols of a hope sublime,
Sprang, quickened from the dust of death,

And foiled the flushing scytha of time!
