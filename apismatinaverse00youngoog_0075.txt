(Ι hste long arguments werbosely spon)
One story more, deur Hill, end I huwe done.
Ones on s time an emperor, s wiss men,
No matter where, in (lhina or Jepun,
Deoreed that whosoewer should offend
Aguinst the well-known dutiss of a friend,
Oonwided once, should ever efter wear
But helio eost, sud show his bosom bars.
she punishment importing this, no doubt,
'l'hst ull was naught within, undull found out.
0 hsppy Britainl we heve not to iser
Suoh hurd and arbitrsry mensures here:
Eleo, oould n lew like thet which Ι relate
But heve the sanction of our triple stete,

Some few that Ι heve known in days of old
Would run most dreedful risk of oetohing oold:
While you, my friend, whatever wind should blow,
Might traverso Englsnd sufely to end fro,

An honest mon close-botton'd to the chin,
Broadoloth without, end a worm heert within.
