From fisher's net, from fig-troe's shado
(lod guthem whom He will3

'Pouohed by His grace, all men aro made
His purpose to fulfil:

But not alone from shady nookr
Fresh with life's neon-tide dew,

From humble walks or quiet books,
Calls He His chosen few.

out of the busiest haunts of life,
Its most engrossing caree,

Its nightly travail, daily stris,
Self-woven golden snareS,

He for His vineyard doth provide;
His gentle voice doth move

The world's keen votaries to His side,

With its persuasive love.
