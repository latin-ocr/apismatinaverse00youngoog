‘Of the fair brotherhood, who share my grace,
Ι. hom thy natal day, pronounee thee frea
And, if for some I keep a nobles place,
I keep for none a happier than for thee

‘'l'here are who, while to wulgar eyes they seem
Of all my bounties lngely to patale,
of me as of some riwsl's handmaid deem,
And court me but for gain's, power’s, fashion's sake.

‘¹1¹0 such, though deep their lore, though wide their fame,
Shnll my great mysteries be all unknown:

Bus thou, hhmugh good and evil, praise and blame,
wila thou not love me for myself alone?

‘Yes, thou wilt love me with exceeding love;
And I will tenfold all that love repay,

Still smiling, though the tendet may reprom,
still faithful, though the trusted may betray.

‘For aye mine emblem was, and aye shall be

'l'he ever-during plant whose bough l wear,

Brightest and greenest then, when every aree
That blossoms in the light of time is hare'

Maeannsn.
