AMIENS' SONG.

Under the greenwood tree
Who loves to lie with me,

And tune his meny note
Unto tho sweet bird’s thxoet—
Come hither, come hither, come hither!
Here shall he see
N ο enemy
But winter and rough weather.

who doeh ambition shun
And loves to live i' the sun,
Seeking the food he eets
And pleaeed with what he gets-
Oome hither, come hither‚ come hither!
Here shall he see
No enemy
But winter end rough weather.
