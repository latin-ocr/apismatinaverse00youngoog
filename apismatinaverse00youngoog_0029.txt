‘'l'he furies of thy brother
With me and mine abido,

If one of your occursed house
Upon blaok Auster ride?
Ae on an Alpino wotoh·e0wer

From heaven eomes down the fleme,
Full on the neck of 'litus
'Phe blnde of Aulus came ;
And out the red blood sponted,
In a wide aroh and tall,
As sponte a fountnin in the court
of some rich Capuan's hell.
'l'he knees of all the Latinos
Were loosened with dismay,

When deod, on dead Herminius,
'Phe brevest Tarquin lay.
