INFANTIS EPITAPHIUM.

Quae modo materna sopita iacebat in ulna
parvula, sed tanto cara puella magis,

nunc alio in gremio-noli nubae—quiescit,
curaque fit summi, quam pretiosa, Patris.

est ut Pastor, ovile tuens terrestre, putarit
hanc superi dignam quae foret agna gregis;

impositamque sinu, nec vim, nec fata timentem,

reddiderit eaelo, venerat unde, suo,

Sweet babo, that late on mother’s arm wast sloeping,
So greatly precious for thy tiny charms3

Rest, rest thee safe to-day in better keeping,
Rosia daang, in the Almighty Father's arms.

Haply the (linist, His sold of this world viewing,
Deem'd thee a lamb too fai} with us to roam;

So hid thee in His breast from Death's undoing,
And bore thee, fearless of his terrors, home.
