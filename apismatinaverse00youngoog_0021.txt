Pher AND PRESEN'P.

I remember‚ Ι remember

'Phe house where I was born,
rho little window where the sun
(lame peeping in at morn3

He never came a wink teo soon ¹
Nor brought teo long a dey;
But now Ι often wish the night
Hed borne my breeth away.

I remember‚ Ι remember

'Phe reses red end white,

'Phe violets and the lily-eupe-
'lhoee fiowere mede of light!
The lilecs where the robin built,

And where my brother eet
'Phe laburnum 011 his hirthday,-

'Phe tree ie living yet.
