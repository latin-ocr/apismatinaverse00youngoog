How best to help the slender stote,
How mend the dwellings, of the p00r3
How gain in life, ns life advancos,

anour nnd charity more and more„

como, Maurice, oome; the lnwn ns yet
Is honr with rime or spongy wet;

But when the wrenth of March has blossomed,

Crocus, anemone, violet,

Or Inter, pay nne visit here,
For those are few we hold ns dear3

Nor pay but one, but come for mnny,

Many nnd many a happy year.
