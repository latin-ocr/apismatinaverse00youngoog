IN MEMORIAM.

If ons should bring ms this report,
Ι 'l'hnt thou hsd’sh touoh'd the land today,
And I went down unto tho quoy,

And found thos lying in the port3

And standing, muffied round with woe,
Should seo thy passongers in rank

come stepping lightly down ohe plsnk,
And bochoning unto those they know;

And if along with thess should come
'Pho man I held as hulf divine;
Should striks a sudden hand in mino,
And osk a thousand Δ11111111 of home;
