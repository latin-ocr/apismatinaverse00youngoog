A 1²AEme

Flow down, oold rivum, to tho sea,

'l'hy mffiuto mo doliver:
Nomorebythoemyuoepsshallbe,

For over and for ever.

Flow, sostly flow, by lawn and len,
A rivulet, then a river:
nowhere by thee my steps shall be,

&mmmm

But hore will sigh thino aldor troo,
And horo thino aspen shiver;
mmwmfflmmm·

For over and for ever.

A thousand suns will stream on thee,
A thousand moons will quiver3

But not by thee my steps shall be,

For ever and for ever.

Tnmson.
