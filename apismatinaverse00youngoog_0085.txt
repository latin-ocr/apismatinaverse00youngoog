nis nord was in its sheath,
His fingers held the pon,
When Kompenfelt went down

with twice four hundred mem

Woigh the vessel up,
Once dreadod by our foas!

And mingle with our cup
'rho tear that Eugland owes.

Her timbers yet aro mund,

And she may float again,
Fufi-oharged with England's thunder‚
And plough tho distant maim

But Kempenfelt is gone3

His victorias are o'er ς

And he and his eight hundsod
shall plough the wave no more.
