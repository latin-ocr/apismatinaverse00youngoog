THE WOODMAN AND HIS DOG.

Forth goes the woodman, leaving unoonoerned
'hhe oheerful haunts of man, to wield the axa
And drive the wedge in yonder forest drean-
From morn to eve his solitary tna

Shaggy, and lean, and shnewd, with pointed ears,
And teil cropped short, half lureher and half eur,
His dog attendo him. Olose behind his heel
Now oreepo he slow; and now, with many a friek
Wido soamporing‚ anatohea up the dnished anow
With ivory beeth, or ploughs it with hie snauh,
Thon shakes hie powdered ooah and barke for joy.
Heedless of nh his pranks, the sturdy ehurl

Moves right toward the mark, nor stopo for ought,

But now and then with pressure of his thumh
'Po adjust the fragrant charge of a short tube
'lhat fumes beneath his noae: the trailing cloud
Streams far behind him, scenting nh the air.

Conana.
