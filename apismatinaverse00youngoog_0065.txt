Omne, when no graver ceree employ‚
audather, wme and see your boy:

Yourpresenoowillbesuninwinoer‚
Making the little one leep for joy.

For being of thet honest few,

who give the Fiend himself his due,
should eighty thousand college-eouncils

'Phunder ‘Anathema,' friend, at y0u;

Should all our churehmen feam in spite
At you, so eareful of the right,
Yet one lay-heerth would give you welcome‚

(Teke it end come) to the Isle of wight3

Where fer from noise and smoke of town,

I weteh the twilight falling brown
All round e caeles-ordered garden
close to the ridge of a noble down.
