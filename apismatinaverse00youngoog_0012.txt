. osi of the verses contained in this volume were
written for my Sixth Form pupils in composition

at Harrow, between the years 1863 end 1877. Five
are of earlier dote, and some ten were done et odd
momente during the fourteen years of my Sherborne
heedmastership (1878-1898). Ι have selected from
a'lsrge accumulation of such pieces those which
seemed to me least unworthy of preservation, in
compliance, too long deleyed, with the wish of sever-el
friends to possess in print what they had been so
good as to velue in manuscript, and on the strength
of their belief that the book might be of interest, end
possibly of some use, to others besides themselves.
Ι heve added a few original preces, which were called
forth by various incidente, merry or sad, arising in
the course of along connection with public school
life.

The Ode on page 198, composed for the Harrow
Tercentenary in 1871, has been set to music by
Mr John Farmer (Horrore Serme Vol. 1.). ΤΙιθ
