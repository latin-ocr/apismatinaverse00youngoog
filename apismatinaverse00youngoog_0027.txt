BLAOK AUS'PER

But, like a graven image,
Black Auster kept his place,
And ever wistfully he looked
Into his master’s face.
'Phe raven-mane that daily,
With pats and fond earesseS,
'Pho young Herminia washed and combed,
And twined i'n even tresses,

And deoked with coloured ribands
From her own gay attire, .

Hung sadly 0'er her father’s corpse,

In oamage and in mire.
Forth with a shout sprang Titum
And seized blank Auster's rein3
'rhen Aulus swaro a femful oath,

And ran at him amain.
