EPI'l'APH ΟΝ Α FBIEND.

oh. ffiend! sor ever loved for ever deest

the fruitless teers heve bsthed thy honour'd bier!
ΨΜ sight reeehoed te thy parting brerth,

Whilst thou west struggling in the penge of death!
sture teers reterd the tyrent in his eourss;

Ceuld sighs svert his dsrt’s relentless force;

Ceuld youth end virtue elsim a short delay,

Or beeuty chsrm the spectro from his prey3

Thou still hedst lived to bless my sehing sight,
Thy eomrede’s honour end thy friend's delight.

If yet thy gentle spirit hever nigh

The spot, where now thy mouldering ashes lie,
Here wilt thou read, recorded on my beart,

A grief too deep to trust the sculptor’s art.

No merble marks thy eoueh of lewly deep,

But living statues there are esen to weep3
