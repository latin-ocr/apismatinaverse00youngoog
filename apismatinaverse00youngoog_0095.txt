SONG.

In the deye when earth was young,
Iaove end henghter ronmed together:

Love took up hie hnrp end sung,
= Ronnd him nl] wne golden weeoher3

But there came a eigh enon-
‘What will be when life is gone?

Leughter then would toy hie eldll,
Song of mirth end joy undying;
But he played his pert so ill,
He set echo all nsighing.
Ewer came an underoone-

‘What will be when lisois doneh'

'lhen for ever, since thet time,
hove no more can live with Laughter3

For bright ae is ohe summer-prime,

Winter pole will follow efter:
hove henoeforth must dwell with Sighs:
Joy was left in Perodise.

A. G. Bonnnn.
