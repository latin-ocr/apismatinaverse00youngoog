ἸΗΕ HOLY GRAIL.

And on I rode, end greater war my thirst.
'lhen fleeh'd e yellow gleem eorose the world,
And where it emoto the plowehere in the field,
'l'he plowmen left hie plowing, and fell down
Before ir; where it glitter’d on her peil,

'l'he milkmeid left her milking, and fell down
Before ir, and Ι knew not why, but thought
‘'l'ho eun is rising,’ tho' the eun hed risen.
'lhen wne Ι ware of one thet on me moved

In golden ermour with a orown of gold

About a eaeque all J'ewele3 end his horse

In golden armour jewell'd everywhere;

And on the splendent oeme, finshing me blind;
And seem'd to me tho Lord of eh the world,
,Being so hugo. But when Ι thought he meent
'1¹0 orush me, moving on me, lo! he, too,
Open’d hie arms to embreoe me ee he ormo,
And up 1 went end touoh’d him, end he, too,
Fell into duet, end Ι was left alone

And weerying in a land of send end thorne.
