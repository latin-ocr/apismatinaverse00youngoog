‘Fether forbeerl for Ι but meet todey
'lhe doom that st my birth wss written down
In Hoeven, ond thou art Hoeven’s unoonsoious hnnd'
Surely my henrt oried out that it was thou,
When first 1 sew thee3 end thy hears epoke too,
Ι know iti but iste trod those promptings down
Under its iron heel; fate, fate engaged
'l'he striis, ond hurled me on my lather’s spesi.
But let us spenk no more of this! Ι find
My lothen let me feel thet Ι heve found
(lome, sit beside me on this send, and keke
My heed betwix‘o thy hands, and kiss my oheeks,
And wssh them with thy teate end say: ‘My son!’
Quiokl qniok! for nnmbered are my sends of life,
And swift; for like the lightning ‘oo this field
¹I seme, end like the wind 1 go away

Sudden, ond swift, ond like a passing wind.
But ie was writ in Hoeven thas this should be.
