ELEGY.

still the balle ring upon the sun-lit grass,

still the big elms, deep shadowed, watoh the play3
And ordered gamo and loyal conflict pass

'Phe hours of May.

But the game's guardian, mute, nor hesding more
what suns may gladden, and what airs may blow‚
Fn'end, toacher, playmate, helper, counsellor,

Lies resting now.

‘Over'—they move, as bids their fieldman's ειη

With shifted soene the strife begins anew3
‘Over'-we seem to hear him, but his part

Is over, too.

Dull the best speed‚ and vain the surest gwace-

So seemed it ever-till theia moved along

Brimmed hat, and cheering presence, and tried face
Amid the throng.
