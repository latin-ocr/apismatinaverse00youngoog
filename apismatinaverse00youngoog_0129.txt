Here blooms in Sherbome and wday,
Unmarked, a miraele of flevere,
Whose seed far centurias away
Was orbed in other elimes than ours:

Strange thought! the very parent-stem,
what rocked its pendent mile-pud,

' Once haply met the gaze of them
what spake with him who spake with God;

Or in some gardan of great kings,
Which erst the Sire of nations knew,

Unfurled the selfsame snowy wings
what next were spread for me and you.

When last the parent poa-flower's soent

Ἴ Did 0'er the fields of summer flit,

Pharaoh’s dark daughter may have bent
Her stately head to feast on it.
