0 bleso Retiremenn fn‘end ιο life's decline,
Renes from core, thet never must be mine,
How blest is he who crowns in shadee like these

A youth of labour with on ege of easo;

who quite o world where strong temptatione try,
And, since ’tis hsrd ιο combot, learns ιο flyl
For him no wretches born ιο work and weep
Explore the mine or temps the dengerous deep:

No surly portet nands in guilty stote

'Po spurn imploring famine from the gote;
Bur on he moves ιο meet his letter end,
Angels oround beffiending virtue's friond3
Sinks ιο the grove with unperceived dercy,
While resignation gontly slopes the wey3
And, all his prospecte brightening ιο che last,

His heaven commences ere the world be past.
