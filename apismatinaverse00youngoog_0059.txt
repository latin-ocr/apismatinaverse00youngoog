‘Fool‚’ he mewefd, ‘death is sure

'l'o thoee thet etey and those thet roem,
But 1 will nevermore endure

'1¹0 sit with empty hands et home.

‘My mother clinga about my neck,
My eietere erying “stey for¹ eheme!’'
My father ravos of death and wreck,
They are all te blame, they ere el] to blame.

‘Godhelpmel eave I tekemypart

Of danger on the mering eea,
A devil riees in my beart,

Fer worse then any death te me’
