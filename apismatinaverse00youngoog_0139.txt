Ἴου, darling3 let them 303' so ran the smin—
‘Yoe, let them go, gain, fashion, plausum, power,
And all the busy elves to whose domuin
Belongs tho nether sphera, the floeting hour.

‘without one envious sigh, one anxious scheme,
'l'he nether sphera, the floeting hour resign.

Mine is the world 01 thought, the world 01 dream,
Mine 0111110000ῒῆ and all the future mina

‘Fortune, that lays in sport the mighty low,
Age, that to penmoe turns the joys 01 youth,

Shall leave untouched the gists which Ι bes‘ww
The sense 01 beauty and the thirst 01 truth.
